The maximum amount of these loans is set at $500 or $1,000, depending on the bank, enabling consumers to borrow as much as they would from a payday lender but at a much lower cost and with strong safeguards. Payday loans usually carry interest rates over 300% and often have unaffordable lump-sum payments that can eat up a large chunk of borrowersâ€™ regular paychecks. In most cases, repeated usage leads to borrowers carrying costly debt for many months.
